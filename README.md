# 100 Reactions

This is where I store my mini React projects. Obviously, it would be nice if I could make 100 of them before I die.

The first several of these were built using Fullstack React's [React Daily UI](https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/). One day I'll probably buy their book.

I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Wes Bos, whose courses I've been recommending to people for almost a year now. His [React for Beginners](https://reactforbeginners.com/) course is awesome.
